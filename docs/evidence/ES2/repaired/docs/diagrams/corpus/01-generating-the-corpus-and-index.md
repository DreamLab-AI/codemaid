## For developers

`sealmap_corpus::generate` projects a `Codebase` into an in-memory map from
output path to text: exactly one Markdown document per source file, plus four
reserved files whose names start with `_` and so never collide with a source
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:12`-`58`). It is pure: equal inputs give
byte-identical output (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:189`-`190`), and every
`CorpusOptions` field is part of that identity, so changing one is reported as
drift by `verify` (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:130`-`132`).

This topic covers the orchestration, the anatomy of a document, and the
`_index.json` merge map that links every call to the fragment that expands it.
The diagrams inside a document are COR-02; checking and writing a directory is
COR-03. Under the accepted design this 1:1 corpus stopped being a committed,
CI-gated artefact and is an optional view under a gitignored `.sealmap/`
(`docs/DESIGN.md:41`, `docs/DESIGN.md:44`-`48`); the code that produces it was
unchanged by that decision.

## For the business

The generated corpus is the mechanical half of the workflow: it is what an
agent reads when it needs the facts about a file without opening the code, and
what an orchestrating agent stitches together to follow a request across
files. Its value to an adopter is that it costs no model tokens to produce and
is identical every time, so it can be regenerated on demand rather than stored
and maintained.

The design's own measurement is the caution: a one-document-per-file Mermaid
corpus is about the same size as the source (`README.md:59`), so it is not a
compression and not what people should read. Its job is to be a reliable,
linkable substrate, not the human map.

## COR-01.1 One call to generate

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant CL as caller
    participant GE as generate<br/>sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:191
    participant LK as Lookup.new<br/>sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:222
    participant DR as document render<br/>document.rs:14
    participant IX as Index<br/>index.rs:101
    CL->>GE: Codebase and CorpusOptions
    GE->>GE: assert every diagram id unique (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:193)
    GE->>IX: new, with stats and generator version (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:194)
    GE->>LK: per-file and per-parent symbol lists (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:195)
    loop each source file in path order
        GE->>DR: file, lookup, options (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:197)
        DR-->>GE: document path, text, DocumentEntry
    end
    GE->>IX: link calls to expanding fragments (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:201)
    GE->>GE: _overview.md, _README.md, _model.json, _index.json (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:203)
    GE-->>CL: Corpus of files and index (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:209)
```

**What it shows.** Generation is a single pass over files in path order, with
the cross-document work (id uniqueness up front, expansion links and the
corpus-level files at the end) around it.

**Why it is this way.** `_model.json` is optional (`emit_model`), the others
are always written (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:205`-`208`). JSON is
compact by default because it is roughly half the size of pretty output
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:153`-`155`).

**Debt:** the index records its generator as `sealmap-corpus` plus the crate
version (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/index.rs:104`), so a version bump with no
other change rewrites `_index.json`, and a kept copy reports drift under
`generate --check` on every release.

## COR-01.2 Anatomy of a document

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant FM as front matter<br/>sealmap schema 2, source, module<br/>quoted, language, source_hash, lines, fragments<br/>document.rs:101-110
    participant H1 as heading<br/>module sym id and source path<br/>document.rs:25
    participant DOC as module doc summary, if any<br/>document.rs:26
    participant PE as parse warning when the module<br/>is tagged parse_error<br/>document.rs:29
    participant ST as structure section<br/>one classDiagram<br/>document.rs:39
    participant SQ as one section per callable with a flow<br/>in source order, headed by its sym id<br/>document.rs:58-61
    participant META as signature and span line, doc summary<br/>document.rs:63-70
    FM->>H1: opens the document
    H1->>DOC: then
    DOC->>PE: when present
    PE->>ST: then
    ST->>SQ: then, one section per callable
    SQ->>META: each section carries its metadata lines
```

**What it shows.** A document is front matter, a heading naming the module by
its `sym:` id, an optional structure diagram and one sequence diagram per
callable that makes calls.

**Why it is this way.** Callables are ordered by span rather than id because
source order reads better inside one file (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/document.rs:57`).
The module id is a JSON-quoted YAML scalar, so ids holding `: ` or ` #` cannot
be misread as structure or comments (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/document.rs:124`-`128`),
and headings use a longer code fence when an id holds backticks
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/document.rs:130`-`134`).

**Invariant:** every generated document opens with `---` front matter whose
first key is the `sealmap: ` marker, and `write` only ever deletes files
whose front matter starts that way
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/document.rs:10`-`12`).

## COR-01.3 The index as types

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant IX as Index<br/>schema_version generator<br/>codebase stats, index.rs:87
    participant DE as DocumentEntry<br/>index.rs:70
    participant FE as FragmentEntry<br/>index.rs:36
    participant CR as CallRef<br/>index.rs:20
    participant FK as FragmentKind, an enum<br/>Structure Sequence, index.rs:11
    Note over IX,DE: Index *-- DocumentEntry, the documents field (index.rs:97)
    Note over IX: fragment(id) is a linear search, index.rs:133
    Note over DE,FE: DocumentEntry *-- FragmentEntry, the fragments field (index.rs:82)
    Note over DE: source document module (index.rs:70)<br/>source_hash document_hash (index.rs:78)
    Note over FE,CR: FragmentEntry *-- CallRef, the calls field (index.rs:53)
    Note over FE: id kind document symbol span (index.rs:36)<br/>sig_hash body_hash (index.rs:49)<br/>participants calls (index.rs:53)<br/>truncated hash (index.rs:59)
    Note over CR: target confidence line (index.rs:20)<br/>expands Option (index.rs:31)
    Note over FE,FK: FragmentEntry --> FragmentKind, the kind field (index.rs:11)
```

**What it shows.** The index lists every document and fragment with its
participants, its calls in source order, the symbol's fingerprints and a hash
of the fragment's own Mermaid text.

**Why it is this way.** A fragment's id is its symbol's `sym:` id for a
sequence and `structure:<file>` for a structure diagram, unique across the
corpus (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/index.rs:37`-`38`); the fragment hash exists
so an orchestrator can cache merged results (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/index.rs:60`).
Fingerprints were added to fragments with schema v2
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:114`).

**Invariant:** `_index.json` and `_model.json` carry ids, spans and
fingerprints in schema v2, pinned by
`schema_v2_json_carries_ids_spans_and_fingerprints`
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/tests/contract.rs:190`).

## COR-01.4 Linking calls to the fragments that expand them

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant GE as generate<br/>sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:191
    participant LE as link_expansions<br/>index.rs:112
    participant OR as orchestrating agent
    GE->>LE: after every document is rendered (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:201)
    LE->>LE: collect ids of all sequence fragments (index.rs:113)
    loop every call of every fragment
        LE->>LE: target has a sequence fragment, set expands (index.rs:119)
    end
    LE-->>GE: index with merge links
    OR->>OR: read _index.json, follow expands to inline a callee
    Note over OR: the merge map is how separately rendered<br/>sequences are stitched across files, corpus_readme.md:54
```

**What it shows.** Once all fragments exist, each call whose target has a
sequence of its own gets an `expands` link to it, which is the whole merge map.

**Why it is this way.** Because a fragment id is the callee's `sym:` id, the
link is a lookup, not a guess (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:50`-`53`);
`index_links_calls_to_expanding_fragments` pins it
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/tests/contract.rs:79`).

## COR-01.5 Per-file lookups built once

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant BEFORE as per document<br/>Codebase.symbols_in_file and<br/>Codebase.children scan every symbol<br/>O of files times symbols<br/>sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:214-215
    participant LK as Lookup.new<br/>one pass over symbols in id order<br/>by file and by parent<br/>sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:227
    participant IF as in_file<br/>same items and order as<br/>symbols_in_file<br/>sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:236-238
    participant CH as children<br/>same items and order as<br/>Codebase.children<br/>sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:241-243
    BEFORE->>LK: replaced by one pass (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:227)
    LK->>IF: by file (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:236-238)
    LK->>CH: by parent (sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:241-243)
```

**What it shows.** The corpus builds its own per-file and per-parent indexes
once per generation instead of calling the model's linear scans per document.

**Why it is this way.** It was part of the hardening (commit `8af26b3`); the
lists keep the order the linear scans produced, so output did not change
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:225`-`226`).

**Invariant:** generation is byte-identical across runs and regardless of the
order sources were inserted (`crates/sealmap-corpus/tests/contract.rs:93`).
