# sealmap diagram corpus

A hand-authored, citation-verified map of the sealmap workspace: one topic
file per subsystem, each explained twice (for whoever inherits the code, and
for the agent-harness owners who adopt sealmap), around Mermaid diagrams whose
every mechanism claim cites `path:line` at the commit stamped in the topic.

This corpus is **not** sealmap's generated output. That is the
one-document-per-source-file corpus `sealmap generate` writes into the
gitignored `.sealmap/` (it was committed as `docs/sealmap/` until step 3).
This one is written by hand with the `diagrams-as-code` method and checked by
`tools/diagram-index-gen.cjs`. It catalogues the state of play and proposes no
fixes; the register is the input to later work, not a plan.

Its citations are still `path:line`; none of its topics is sealed yet. Sealing
this corpus with `sealmap seal sign` is step 6 of the design (DEL-02.6 lists
what stands in the way). Topics are verified against `b9a6aeb`, the last of
the ER review fixes, except COR-01 and COR-04, whose citations did not move
and stay on `4ed7a51`; the corpus was first written at `af4b8b4`.
Governing documents: [`docs/DESIGN.md`](../DESIGN.md) (accepted
design) and the root [`README.md`](../../README.md). There are no ADRs.

## Doors

- **New to the code?** Read in order: MOD-01 (ids) → MOD-03 (the model) →
  EXT-01 (the adapter pipeline) → COR-01 (the generated corpus) → COR-04
  (seals).
- **Deciding whether to adopt sealmap in a harness?** Read the "For the
  business" sections of MOD-02, EXT-05, COR-04, COR-05, DEL-01 and DEL-02, then
  [REGISTER.md](REGISTER.md).
- **Changing the resolver or the walker?** EXT-03, EXT-04, EXT-05, and the
  Debt rows from them in the register.
- **Sealing a corpus, or wiring the seal gate into a harness?** COR-04 (what
  each class means and where it is decided), then COR-05 (the commands and
  their exit codes).
- **Planning 0.2 work?** DEL-02 is the gap between `docs/DESIGN.md` and the
  code; [DECISIONS-TIMELINE.md](DECISIONS-TIMELINE.md) is how it got here.

## Areas

| Area | Prefix | Covers |
|---|---|---|
| model | MOD | `sealmap-model`: the `sym:` grammar, hashes and fingerprints, the `Codebase`, sources, schema v2 |
| extract | EXT | `sealmap-extract` plus `sealmap-rust`: the adapter pipeline, ids, flow walker, lowering and confidence, resolution, fingerprinting |
| mermaid | MER | `sealmap-mermaid`: typed writers, escaping, injective diagram ids |
| corpus | COR | `sealmap-corpus` plus the facade and CLI: generate, the index, projections, write and `generate --check`; seals, the lock and the seal commands |
| delivery | DEL | CI, the MSRV job, determinism, publication, and design versus code |

## Checking and regenerating

From the repository root:

```sh
node docs/diagrams/tools/diagram-index-gen.cjs docs/diagrams --check --cite-check --strict-citations
node docs/diagrams/tools/diagram-index-gen.cjs docs/diagrams --check --render   # needs mmdc
node docs/diagrams/tools/diagram-index-gen.cjs docs/diagrams                    # rewrites the block below, COVERAGE.md, REGISTER.md
```

`rendered/` is gitignored. When code changes, re-read the cited symbols at the
new commit, correct the lines that moved, and bump that topic's
`verified_commit`; leave topics whose sources did not change on their stamp.
