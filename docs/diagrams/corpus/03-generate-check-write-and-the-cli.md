## For developers

`verify` and `write` in `contract.rs` are the 0.1 contract between a generated
corpus and a directory on disk. `verify_against` compares a freshly generated
`Corpus` with what a directory holds and classifies every difference as
missing, orphaned, stale or modified; `write` brings the directory into
compliance and only ever deletes files that carry the generator's header
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/contract.rs:1`-`2`,
`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:11`-`28`).

Since step 3 the command line reaches that contract only through
`sealmap generate`: plain `generate` writes, and `generate --check` compares
and writes nothing (`crates/sealmap/src/main.rs:269`-`280`). The name `verify`
now belongs to the seal gate (COR-04, COR-05), and nothing generated is
committed; CI checks instead that two fresh generations agree (DEL-01). This
topic draws the generate path, the drift classes and the shared flags.

## For the business

The generated corpus is a view, rebuilt in seconds whenever someone wants it,
and never a file set a pipeline has to keep in step. A developer who keeps a
copy on disk can ask whether it is still current with one flag, and gets an
exact answer: which files are missing, which are left over, which are out of
date because the code changed, and which were edited by hand or by a
different generator version.

For an adopter migrating from 0.1, the one change to plan for is the name:
a pipeline that ran `sealmap verify` against a committed corpus now wants
`sealmap generate --check`, and `sealmap verify` means the seal gate.

## COR-03.1 sealmap generate, end to end

        CT-->>GE: Report
        GE-->>US: one padded line per drift, exit 1 if any (main.rs:272, main.rs:279)
    else write
        GE->>CT: bring DIR into compliance (main.rs:281)
        GE-->>US: counts written, removed, unchanged (main.rs:284)
    end
```

**What it shows.** Both branches regenerate the whole corpus in memory first;
`--check` then compares and `write` repairs, and nothing is trusted from disk
except the bytes being compared.

**Why it is this way.** The extraction helper returns the codebase name it
used, so `stale --since` can read a second tree under the same name
(`crates/sealmap/src/main.rs:336`-`339`). Errors in arguments or IO exit 2,
drift under `--check` exits 1 (`crates/sealmap/src/main.rs:215`,
`crates/sealmap/src/main.rs:279`). A drift name is padded through
`to_string`, because `Drift`'s `Display` writes with `write_str` and ignores a
width (`crates/sealmap/src/main.rs:272`,
`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/contract.rs:32`).

## COR-03.2 Classifying a difference

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    E["each expected file<br/>src/contract.rs:80"]
    A{"present in the directory?<br/>src/contract.rs:81"}
    MIS["Missing<br/>src/contract.rs:82"]
    EQ{"byte-identical?<br/>src/contract.rs:83"}
    OK["clean"]
    RS{"reserved underscore file?<br/>src/contract.rs:85"}
    MOD1["Modified<br/>src/contract.rs:86"]
    FH{"same source_hash in<br/>the front matter?<br/>src/contract.rs:89"}
    MOD2["Modified: hand edit or new<br/>generator or options<br/>src/contract.rs:90"]
    STA["Stale: the source changed<br/>src/contract.rs:91"]
    ORP["each md on disk not expected<br/>and carrying the header: Orphaned<br/>src/contract.rs:99-100"]
    E --> A
    A -->|no| MIS
    A -->|yes| EQ
    EQ -->|yes| OK
    EQ -->|no| RS
    RS -->|yes| MOD1
    RS -->|no| FH
    FH -->|yes| MOD2
    FH -->|no| STA
    E -.-> ORP
```

**What it shows.** The front-matter source hash is what separates "the code
changed" from "the document was touched"; anything in the directory that is
not a generated document is ignored.

**Why it is this way.** Recording the source hash in each document makes drift
detectable without re-parsing the old state (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/lib.rs:15`-`16`);
`verify_classifies_every_kind_of_drift` pins all four classes
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/tests/contract.rs:106`).

**Debt:** a reserved file is always `Modified` when it differs
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/contract.rs:85`-`86`), even when the difference is
that the code changed, so `_index.json` and `_model.json` never report stale.

## COR-03.3 A corpus file's drift states

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Clean: generate then write
    Clean --> Stale: source edited
    Clean --> Modified: document hand-edited
    Clean --> Modified: generator version or options change
    Clean --> Orphaned: source deleted
    [*] --> Missing: new source
    Stale --> Clean: write rewrites it
    Modified --> Clean: write rewrites it
    Missing --> Clean: write creates it
    Orphaned --> [*]: write deletes it and empty parents
```

**What it shows.** Every drift is repaired by `write` in one step: stale,
modified and missing files are written, orphaned generated documents are
deleted, and unchanged files are not touched.

**Why it is this way.** Untouched files keep their mtimes, so a re-run is cheap
for anything watching the directory (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/contract.rs:138`-`141`);
`write_converges_and_is_idempotent` pins that a second `write` changes
nothing (`crates/sealmap-corpus/tests/contract.rs:138`).

**Invariant:** `write` deletes only Markdown files whose YAML front matter
opens on the first line (`---`) and whose first key is the `sealmap: `
marker; a file that merely mentions the marker anywhere else is never touched
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/contract.rs:99`, `crates/sealmap-corpus/src/document.rs:153`-`155`).

## COR-03.4 Reading a directory

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    D["corpus directory"]
    EX{"exists?<br/>src/contract.rs:111"}
    EMP["empty map: every file Missing"]
    RR["recursive read, entries sorted by name<br/>src/contract.rs:119"]
    UT{"readable as UTF-8 and<br/>relative to the root?<br/>src/contract.rs:125"}
    IN["path to text<br/>src/contract.rs:126"]
    SK["skipped"]
    D --> EX
    EX -->|no| EMP
    EX -->|yes| RR --> UT
    UT -->|yes| IN
    UT -->|no| SK
```

**What it shows.** The directory is read into the same path-to-text map the
generator produces, in sorted order, so the comparison is a map diff.

**Why it is this way.** Sorting entries keeps the report order independent of
the file system (`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/contract.rs:119`); the whole corpus
can also be summarised as one hash for cheap cross-machine equality
(`crates/sealmap-corpus/src/contract.rs:174`-`183`).

## COR-03.5 Commands, flags and the facade

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    CMD["generate, model, dense, resolve, seal-check,<br/>verify, stale, seal sign<br/>main.rs:42-66"]
    SRC["shared source flags: --repo, --name, --tests<br/>main.rs:71-81"]
    GEN["generate only: -o, --check, --external,<br/>--owner-lanes, --min-calls, --public-only,<br/>--no-model, --pretty<br/>main.rs:84-114"]
    MOD["model: path, source flags, --external<br/>main.rs:117-126"]
    DNS["dense: path, source flags, -o, --depth,<br/>--external, --stats<br/>main.rs:129-147"]
    OP["Options: rust and corpus halves<br/>sealmap/src/lib.rs:98"]
    ONE["one directory: load_dir<br/>main.rs:352"]
    MANY["several repos, each prefixed NAME/<br/>load_repos, sealmap/src/lib.rs:125"]
    CMD --> SRC
    CMD --> GEN
    CMD --> MOD
    CMD --> DNS
    GEN --> OP
    SRC --> ONE
    SRC --> MANY
```

**What it shows.** Every command shares the flags that shape ids; only
`generate` carries the projection flags, and `model` takes the external-call
policy because it changes the flows it prints. Several repositories are
loaded into one `SourceSet` under name prefixes, so calls between them
resolve and the overview groups crates by repository
(`crates/sealmap/src/lib.rs:112`-`113`).

**Why it is this way.** The source flags decide which symbols exist and what
they are called, so a seal must be checked with the flags it was signed with
(`crates/sealmap/src/main.rs:68`-`69`); the facade exists so the common path
is one dependency (`crates/sealmap/src/lib.rs:35`-`36`), and the CLI is behind
the default `cli` feature, so a library user does not pull in clap.
